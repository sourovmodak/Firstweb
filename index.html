            <h3>Web developer</h3>
            <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.There are no formal educational or licensure requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles, which teach web development, freely available on the web - for example Basic JavaScript
            Even though there are no formal educational requirements, dealing with web developing projects requires those who wish to be referred to as web developers to have advanced knowledge/skills in:HTML/XHTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.Server/client side architecture like all or some of the above mentioned.Programming/Coding/Scripting in one of the many server-side languages or frameworks (e.g., Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, CFML - ColdFusion, Java, ASP, ASP.NET, Node.js)
            Ability to utilize a database</p>

            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma how to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics. Front-end developers (also known as client-side development) use a variety of programming languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the exterior look and features of a site. Back-end developers use programming languages such as Python and Ruby to design, build and integrate applications from front-end development into the back end—in other words, they make the features on the site operate. Individuals with skills in both front- and back-end development are known as “full-stack developers.”</p>
